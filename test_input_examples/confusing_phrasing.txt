Let’s talk about Alina Kowalski. Age-wise? Around 26 or so. Works somewhere in finance — I think it’s a place called Emerald Funds in Boston. Studied economics in Europe. Speaks Polish and English. Likes running marathons and baking. Not sure about her favorite language, but she uses Excel a lot. Oh, and red’s her color. No clue if she has LinkedIn.
